-Set up the reset and global styles for less. I used the fun bus files as a basline to jump off of. Feel free to check that out and let me know if you think anything needs to be changed.
-I have my html mostly filled out, I just need to learn how to implement the carousel.

--- CSS Stuff ---
-First I have a "container" div inside my body tag over the rest of my page that I've given the max-width of 1200px. Since it's such a simple page, I don't want it to stretch out too far. 1200px may even be too big, I'll have to play around with it to be sure.

-For classes I have the "container" that I mentioned, a "top" class that includes the carousel and the little question mark from the wireframe, and a "mid" class that holds the rest of the content above the footer.
-I've also added a "landing" class into the same "container" div that way I can use the specificity to refer just to the landing page, as to not affect the about page.

-I only have 1 id, the "carousel" id.
