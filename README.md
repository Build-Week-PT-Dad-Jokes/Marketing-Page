Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
Young mobile adult with social media

    - What feedback have you gotten from potential users?

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation. Spend the weekend researching so you can hit the ground running on Monday.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.



Pitch: You're a funny guy, but you keep losing your list of jokes and forgetting which ones had the best reactions! Well worry no more- Dad (or bad??) jokes app to the rescue.

MVP:
-Onboarding process for a new user
-Ability for an unregistered user to view dad jokes listed as 'public'.
-Ability to add a new joke, including listing as public or private. Hitting save adds to the public feed, the joke wallet, or both. Ability to edit or delete jokes.
-Ability to search jokes by key words both on the public feed and within a user's account.

Stretch: In app messaging to send a joke to another registered user. Ability to add pictures to user profile.
